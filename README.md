Hello,

I have been involved in passionate programming ventures for 7+ years now, and my enjoyment in helping others haven't diminished a bit, on the contrary, the more technologies I work with, the more excited I get on conquering new challenges and goals.

I specialize in web development, systems integrations, database systems, workflow automations and process optimizations, and also have a very good understanding of business analysis as well as solution architecture and design.

I have worked on SaaS products, Marketplaces, Healthcare, Insurance, Travel Portal, Stock Markets ERP solution, iOS/Android app with React Native etc.
